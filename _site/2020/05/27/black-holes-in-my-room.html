<p><br />
For a long time now, I suspected the black screens of my phone and laptop hide well-camouflaged black holes. I wake up, take a look at them, and my day just flies by, as if sucked in by some magical, technological force.</p>

<p>So, I decided to track my digital usage and investigate. One year later I’m looking at the data, and I need to come to terms with a harsh truth: My laptop and phone are undeniably black holes, and I need to fix that.</p>

<!--  tried everything: I denied their existence, I got angry at them for existing, I even tried to bargain with them.-->
<p>Here’s the irrefutable evidence:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Any time I get close to them, I get sucked in and end up spending <em>hours on end</em> browsing the internet, binge-watching a show, or reading the never ending stream of breaking news. (<em>Sidenote</em>: Why is all news <strong>BREAKING NEWS</strong> nowadays?)</li>
  <li>I wake up and the first thing I look at is my phone: <em>‘Do I have any new messages’</em>, <em>‘What’s trending in the world’</em>. Just like that, a chunk of my morning disappears into the black hole. Even during lunch, I will often feel the appealing pull of my laptop, and watch a talk show while I’m eating.</li>
  <li>If I have a break during the day, I’ll glance at my phone and scroll through the notifications, and at night, my phone or laptop is often the last interaction I will have with the world.</li>
</ul>

<p>At this point, I will take pity on those with a basic understanding of physics: and admit: Ok, they’re not really black holes; after all, it is possible to escape them: If I have some place to be, or an assignment due in the next hour. But they do <em>feel like black holes</em>, and unfortunately it’s not always easy to escape them.</p>

<p>Endless newsfeeds of exciting posts, constant push notifications with fun updates, autoplaying the next media piece as I finish the current one, make the web a very engaging and low-effort place for my downtime. Unfortunately, it also makes it too easy to get sucked in. After a while of browsing the web when things were boring, it slowly but surely turned into an unhealthy habit which now consumes a disproportionate amount of time.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.washingtonblade.com/content/files/2016/03/30_days_insert_by_Bigstock.jpg" height="400px" width="auto" /></p>

<p>In order to curb my digital overuse, I developed a list of habits to follow over the next 30 days:</p>

<ol>
  <li>No screen-time for the first hour of the day.</li>
  <li>No screen-time for the last 30 minutes of my day.</li>
  <li>No online distractions (complete ban on browsing reddit + other online distractions).</li>
  <li>At most total screen-time of 3 hours a day during the work week (outside of work time) and 9 hours a day during the weekend. <em>This one, I may adjust later on if I see it as too permissive.</em></li>
</ol>

<h3 id="staying-accountable">Staying accountable</h3>

<p>I am using 2 main productivity tools for this goal: <strong><a href="https://www.proginosko.com/leechblock/">LeechBlock</a> and <a href="https://activitywatch.net/">ActivityWatch</a></strong>.</p>

<ul>
  <li><em>LeechBlock</em> is a simple browser extension I use to block websites or set time limits for them. Because browsing some websites has become such an ingrained habit (Youtube, Netflix, Reddit, etc), in times of boredom I often mindlessly navigate to them. LeechBlock will stop me in my tracks when I access them out of habit, and block me from using them completely.</li>
  <li><em>ActivityWatch</em> is a free, <a href="https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/open-source/what-is-open-source">open-source</a>, computer program which tracks how I spend my time digitally, and displays it in an easy way to digest.<!--The data is only stored locally on your devices, so it is fully secure, and is never shared with anybody.--> I used them to analyze the extent of my bad digital habits.</li>
</ul>

<p>I wrote a small computer script which <strong>will automatically analyze the data from ActivityWatch, and post my progress online (in this blogpost) for each of the 4 goals, every day, for the next 30 days</strong>. <em>Yes, I could just update the blog manually, but where’s the fun in that?</em></p>

<p>Starting today :)</p>
