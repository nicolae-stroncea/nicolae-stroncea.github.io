The [Rakuten Cashback app](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/rakuten-get-cash-back-for/chhjbpecpncaggjpdakmflnfcopglcmi) is a popular browser extension that applies discounts when you shop online and gives you cash back on your purchases. **For Free!** I know what you're thinking: "So you're saying there's a company out there that will save me money out of the goodness of their corporate hearts? I would be a fool not to!". But before you click *Install* and skip the 6000-words-long [Privacy Policy pt.1](https://web.archive.org/web/20220709105501/https://www.rakuten.com/help/article/privacy-policy-360002101688) and [Privacy Policy pt.2](https://web.archive.org/web/20220217095516/https://www.rakuten.com/help/article/rakuten-cash-back-button-privacy-notice-360052819794), find out what's in the sausage and why your dog refuses to eat it.

## What's in the Privacy Policy

### Rakuten collects your browsing history

According to the Privacy Policy, the app collects the **URL of any page you visit** along with the **date and time** of your visits [^1]. Effectively, this means Rakuten may have a complete trail of everything you consume in your browser: every website you've been on including all the content you read (Twitter, Reddit, BuzzFeed, Wikipedia, all of it) and everything you watch (Youtube, Netflix, Disney et al). If you want to see what this information looks like, go into your browser's history: everything that's in there could also be on Rakuten's servers.

### Rakuten collects your search history

Rakuten may also collect your search history [^1]. Any search you made on Google for the new Mac, a weird rash, a celebrity's net worth, Rakuten might know about it.

### Rakuten collects your email Inbox Data

If you sign up with your Google Account or link your email manually, you are also giving Rakuten access to reading your emails [^1]. The usage of this data is governed by Rakuten's Privacy Policy and [The Google Api Services User Data Policy](https://developers.google.com/terms/api-services-user-data-policy). The latter places additional restrictions on Rakuten's (in my opinion) broad use of your email information. Mainly, Rakuten is not allowed to use your email contents to advertise to you. They may however use your emails to identify trends and perform statistical analyses to improve their services and those of their business partners.

## Why does Rakuten collect all this data

### Legitimate use cases

Rakuten collects this data to be able to provide its service (discounts and cashback) and give you better recommendations such as offers from your most frequently visited stores, from similar stores or from Rakuten itself.

### Selling your data

Rakuten admits midway through their policy that they *share* the information they have on you with third parties whose core business is buying your personal information (browsing history, IP addresses, pages viewed) so that they can use this information to serve you ads. The privacy policy you agree to only covers how Rakuten uses this data, and whatever the third parties do Rakuten says is up to them [^2].

It's hard to grasp all the sensitive private information that's captured in our browsing and search history. The New York Times told a [cautionary tale](https://www.nytimes.com/2006/08/09/technology/09aol.html) about this when in 2006, the research division of AOL made public three months of data from its search engine from 500,000 users. AOL kept users anonymous by assigning a unique number to each person. The search data featured deeply intimate questions such as "birth defects caused by father's cocaine use" from user 98280, and "signs divorce is on its way" from user 3067593. The NYTimes article tried to identify user 4417749, who searched for "numb fingers", "60 single men", and "dog that urinates on everything". The search ultimately lead to Thelma Arnold, a 62-year old from Lilburn that had also searched more personal queries such as "landscapers in Lilburn", "homes sold in shadow lake subdivision gwinnett county georgia", and multiple people with the last name Arnold. "My goodness, it’s my whole personal life”, Ms. Arnold said when she discussed her searches with the NYTimes reporter. How much of their users' life does Rakuten *share*?

Just as troubling, Rakuten admits they **may accidentally capture your address and partial payment information** in all the information they collect on you [^3]. Can they guarantee they don't accidentally *share* that too?

Rakuten admits that for California residents this "may be considered a 'sale' of your personal information per the CCPA" (California Consumer Privacy Act) [^2]. And if you're not from California, this is just them sharing your information with third parties in exchange for monetary or other valuable consideration. What was that called again?

## What is the risk

Installing this cashback extension gives Rakuten, a corporate giant working in e-commerce, advertising and finance, free access to your browsing history, search history and (potentially) emails. Do you trust Rakuten to use this information in your best interests? Do you trust them to be secure enough? What about the countless unnamed affiliate partners, refferal marketing partners, financial partners, and digital advertising providers that Rakuten shares your information with? What do they do with all your data and who do they sell it to?

Given all of these concerns, the risks of Rakuten Cashback far outweigh its promises. Don't eat this sausage and don't feed it to your dog either.
