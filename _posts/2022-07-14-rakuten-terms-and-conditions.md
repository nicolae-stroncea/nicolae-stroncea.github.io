<!-- What I found in the Rakuten Privacy Policy -->

The [Rakuten Cashback app](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/rakuten-get-cash-back-for/chhjbpecpncaggjpdakmflnfcopglcmi) is a browser extension that applies discounts when you shop online and gives you cash back on your purchases. **For Free!** I know what you're thinking: "So you're saying there's a company out there that will save me money out of the goodness of their corporate hearts? I would be a fool not to!". But before you click *Install* and skip the 6000-words-long [Privacy Policy pt.1](https://web.archive.org/web/20220709105501/https://www.rakuten.com/help/article/privacy-policy-360002101688) and [Privacy Policy pt.2](https://web.archive.org/web/20220217095516/https://www.rakuten.com/help/article/rakuten-cash-back-button-privacy-notice-360052819794), find out what's in the sausage and why your dog refuses to eat it.

## What's in the Privacy Policy

### Rakuten collects your browsing history

According to the Privacy Policy, the app collects the **URL of any page you visit** along with the **date and time** of your visits [^1]. Effectively, this means Rakuten may have a complete trail of everything you consume in your browser: every website you've been on including all the content you read (Twitter, Reddit, BuzzFeed, Wikipedia, all of it) and everything you watch (Youtube, Netflix, Disney et al). If you want to see what this information looks like, go into your browser's history: everything that's in there could also be on Rakuten's servers.

### Rakuten collects your search history

Rakuten may also collect your search history [^1]. Any search you made on Google for the new Mac, a weird rash, a celebrity's net worth, Rakuten might know about it.

### Rakuten collects your email Inbox Data

If you sign up with your Google Account or link your email manually, you are also giving Rakuten access to reading your emails [^1]. The usage of this data is governed by Rakuten's Privacy Policy and [The Google Api Services User Data Policy](https://developers.google.com/terms/api-services-user-data-policy). The latter places additional restrictions on Rakuten's (in my opinion) broad use of your email information. Mainly, Rakuten is not allowed to use your email contents to advertise to you. They may however use your emails to identify trends and perform statistical analyses to improve their services and those of their business partners.

## Why does Rakuten collect all this data

### Legitimate use cases

Rakuten collects this data to be able to provide its service (discounts and cashback) and give you better recommendations such as offers from your most frequently visited stores, from similar stores or from Rakuten itself.

### Selling your data

Rakuten admits midway through their policy that they *share* your information with third parties whose core business is buying your personal information (browsing history, IP addresses, pages viewed) so that they can use this information to serve you ads. The privacy policy you agree to only covers how Rakuten uses this data, and whatever the third parties do Rakuten says is up to them [^2]. Just as troubling, Rakuten admits they may accidentally capture your address and partial payment information in all the information they collect on you [^3]. Can they guarantee they don't accidentally sell that too?

Rakuten is bound by Californian law to admit this "may be considered a 'sale' for Californian residents". What it may be considered for non-Californian residents is an exercise left to the reader (*spoiler alert*: it's still a sale).

## What is the risk

Installing this cashback extension gives Rakuten, a corporate giant working in e-commerce, advertising and finance, free access to your browsing history, search history and (potentially) emails. Do you trust Rakuten to use this information in your best interests? Do you trust them to be secure enough? What about the countless unnamed affiliate partners, refferal marketing partners, financial partners, and digital advertising providers that Rakuten shares your information with? What do they do with all your data and who do they sell it to?

Given all of these concerns, the risks of Rakuten Cashback far outweigh its promises. Don't eat this sausage and don't feed it to your dog either.
