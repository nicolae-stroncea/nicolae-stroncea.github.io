## The Black Hole Theory

<br>
For a long time now, I suspected the black screens of my phone and laptop hide well-camouflaged black holes. I wake up, take a look at them, and my day just flies by, as if sucked in by some magical, technological force.

So, I decided to track my digital usage and investigate. One year later I'm looking at the data, and I need to come to terms with a harsh truth: My laptop and phone are undeniably black holes, and I need to fix that.

<!--  tried everything: I denied their existence, I got angry at them for existing, I even tried to bargain with them.-->
 Here's the irrefutable evidence:

* Any time I get close to them, I get sucked in and end up spending *hours on end* browsing the internet, binge-watching a show, or reading the never ending stream of breaking news. (*Sidenote*: Why is all news **BREAKING NEWS** nowadays?)
* I wake up and the first thing I look at is my phone: *'Do I have any new messages'*, *'What's trending in the world'*. Just like that, a chunk of my morning disappears into the black hole. Even during lunch, I will often feel the appealing pull of my laptop, and watch a talk show while I'm eating.
* If I have a break during the day, I'll glance at my phone and scroll through the notifications, and at night, my phone or laptop is often the last interaction I will have with the world.

At this point, I will take pity on those with a basic understanding of physics: and admit: Ok, they're not really black holes; after all, it is possible to escape them: If I have some place to be, or an assignment due in the next hour. But they do *feel like black holes*, and unfortunately it's not always easy to escape them.

Endless newsfeeds of exciting posts, constant push notifications with fun updates, autoplaying the next media piece as I finish the current one, make the web a very engaging and low-effort place for my downtime. Unfortunately, it also makes it too easy to get sucked in. After a while of browsing the web when things were boring, it slowly but surely turned into an unhealthy habit which now consumes a disproportionate amount of time.


## The Plan

<img src="https://www.washingtonblade.com/content/files/2016/03/30_days_insert_by_Bigstock.jpg" height="400px" width="auto"/>

In order to curb my digital overuse, I developed a list of habits to follow over the next 30 days:

1. No screen-time for the first hour of the day.
2. No screen-time for the last 30 minutes of my day.
3. No online distractions (complete ban on browsing reddit + other online distractions).
4. At most total screen-time of 3 hours a day during the work week (outside of work time) and 9 hours a day during the weekend. *This one, I may adjust later on if I see it as too permissive.*

### Staying accountable

I am using 2 main productivity tools for this goal: **[LeechBlock](https://www.proginosko.com/leechblock/) and [ActivityWatch](https://activitywatch.net/)**.

* *LeechBlock* is a simple browser extension I use to block websites or set time limits for them. Because browsing some websites has become such an ingrained habit (Youtube, Netflix, Reddit, etc), in times of boredom I often mindlessly navigate to them. LeechBlock will stop me in my tracks when I access them out of habit, and block me from using them completely.
* *ActivityWatch* is a free, [open-source](https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/open-source/what-is-open-source), computer program which tracks how I spend my time digitally, and displays it in an easy way to digest.<!--The data is only stored locally on your devices, so it is fully secure, and is never shared with anybody.--> I used them to analyze the extent of my bad digital habits.

I wrote a small computer script which **will automatically analyze the data from ActivityWatch, and post my progress online (in this blogpost) for each of the 4 goals, every day, for the next 30 days**. *Yes, I could just update the blog manually, but where's the fun in that?*

Starting today :)
